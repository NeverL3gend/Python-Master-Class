Numeric Data Types
Python3 has three numeric data types:
- int
- float
- complex

Integer & Float Data types
The Python integer data type is called int.
- Integers are just whole numbers -> numbers having no fractional part.
- Float is another name for real numbers -> numbers having a fractional part after the decimal point.


Python Sequence Types
Python 3 has 5 sequence types built in:
    - The string type
    - List
    - Tuple
    - Range
    - Bytes and Bytearray

What is a Sequence?

A sequence is deined as an ordered set of items
For example, the string "Hello World" contains 11 items, and each item is a character

A List is alos a sequence  type. For example, here's a Python list of things you might need, when buying a new computer:
parts = ["computer", "monitor", "keyboard", "mouse", "mouse mat"]
parts[1] # will give us monitor
parts[1][0] # will give us m
