# Each number should print out on a new line (which is the default behaviour of print)

# for i in range (10):
#     print (i)

#basically we have a starting point of 0 and we're going up to but not including 10 and we're going up by 3's

#For loop Exercise 9

# write a program that will list all the numbers from 0 to 100 that are divisible by 7

# this is going to print out the numbers 0 to 100

    #here I want to divde every number by 7
    print (i)
