If Blocks:
- A block can be quite complex, including furhter "if" and "else" blocks (and much more) contained within it.
- When testsing for equality, we can't use a single = symbol. = is used for assigning values to cariables, 
so when testing for equality we have to use ==
- An if statement can inclide many elid parts, but there can be only one else. elif is short for "else if"
- The "else", if there is one, must come eafter all the "elif" blocks
- Duplicating code is generally a bad idea -  there's almost always a better way.

Conditional Operators:
- When testing conditions, we can use any of the value comparison operators.
- There are other types of comparisons we can perform, but we'll focus on these 6 for now:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|Condition                    | Symbols  |
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
|    Less than               |  >        |
|    Less than or equal to   | <=        |
|    Greater Than            | >         |
|    Greater than or equal to| >=        |
|    Equal to                | ==        |
|    Not equal to            | !=        |
